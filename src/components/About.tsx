          Hi, I'm Faheem Hamid, a Full Stack Developer with 1.5+ years of
          experience in the MERN stack, Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. I've
          worked on dynamic web applications, integrating APIs with React using
          Axios and Fetch. I'm also experienced in Generative AI and prompt
          engineering. With strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
          libraries like Redux, React Router, and Ant Design, I create seamless,
          user-friendly interfaces. On the backend, I specialize in building
          RESTful APIs with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for scalable
          applications
